    <h3>Who Am I</h3>
        <p>I started a course on Web Design on 2009, learning HTML and CSS fundamentals so I could use the Web better</p>
		<p>On 2012 I started my major in Psychology, which I've dropped out after 5 years. The experience was good and I got it, but I didn't care about the paper in the end</p>
		<p>Right now I'm focused on educating myself efficiently. Done a few courses on Udacity about Design and Machine Learning, but I mainly learn researching on my own and talking to people who know more than me.</p>
		<p>My current interest is to implement an experience to Recruitment processes that make people go WOW. How am I doing so far? :)</p>
  <h3>What I Do</h3>

		<p>As a Recruiter I've worked in one the biggest Consulting firms in the world, Michael Page, leading the Technology and Digital divisions and recruiting Tech people for a bunch of companies.</p>
